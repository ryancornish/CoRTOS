/**

 * @brief Lock-free Multi-Producer Single-Consumer (MPSC) ring buffer
 *
 * A high-performance, wait-free ring buffer that allows multiple producers
 * to concurrently push elements while a single consumer pops them.
 *
 * Key properties:
 * - Lock-free for producers (multiple threads can push concurrently)
 * - Wait-free for consumer (single thread, no blocking)
 * - Cache-line aligned to minimize false sharing
 * - Zero memory allocation after construction
 * - Compile-time constructable
 * - Compile-time fixed capacity (power of 2)

/**
 * @brief Lock-free Multi-Producer Single-Consumer ring buffer
 *
 * @tparam T Element type (must be nothrow destructible)
 * @tparam N Buffer capacity (must be power of 2, > 0)
 *
 * Thread safety:
 * - push(): Safe to call from multiple threads concurrently
 * - pop(): Must ONLY be called from a single thread (the consumer)
 * - approx_size(): Safe but may be stale under contention
 *
 * Memory ordering:
 * - Uses acquire/release semantics for synchronization
 * - Producers synchronize via atomic head counter
 * - Consumer has exclusive access to tail counter
 * - Cell sequences enforce happens-before relationships
 *
 * Performance characteristics:
 * - push(): Wait-free in uncontended case, lock-free under contention
 * - pop(): Wait-free (never blocks or spins)
 * - Both operations are O(1)
 * - Cache-line aligned to avoid false sharing (64-byte alignment)
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @code
 *   MpscRingBuffer<Event, 256> queue;
 *
 *   // Producer threads (multiple)
 *   void producer_thread() {
 *     Event evt = create_event();
 *     if (!queue.push(std::move(evt))) {
 *       // Buffer full, handle overflow
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   // Consumer thread (single)
 *   void consumer_thread() {
 *     Event evt;
 *     while (queue.pop(evt)) {
 *       process(evt);
 *     }
 *   }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Algorithm:
 * Based on Dmitry Vyukov's MPMC queue adapted for single consumer.
 * Each cell has a sequence number that tracks its state:
 * - sequence == position: Cell is ready for producer to write
 * - sequence == position + 1: Cell contains data for consumer to read
 * - sequence == position + N: Cell is empty, waiting for wraparound
 *
 * Producers use CAS on head to claim slots, then write data and publish
 * by updating the cell sequence. Consumer reads tail exclusively.
